# SERGIO BRAVO SANTOS
## Artificial Intelligence Graduate

I am a graduated in Artificial Intelligence with 2 years of experience in data analytics and modelling software. I have studied and worked with many different programming languages since I started my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, but I am especially experienced in Python and python Machine Learning libraries. 

In my professional career, I have been in charge of the maintenance of a big recommendation system for a new's page, optimized a system that created services itineraries for improving the work situation of unemployed people and I published an article for the 2020 QUATIC's conference presenting a chatbot's testing tool. 

I am motivated to learn the more I can about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Analysis and Big Data Processing as I am also interested in other fields such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Internet of Things... 

My goal is to grow personally and professionally as I enjoy the time of been part of a team. 

### Projects 
#### Task Calendar
In this project, a genetic algorithm is used to assign each of the people of a list to each of the fixed tasks in a calendar. In the following page: 
[Tasks Calendar](https://github.com/SerBravoSantos/Sergio-Bravo-Santos/blob/gh-pages/TasksCalendar.md)
We can find:
- How to use the genetic algorithm to obtain an organized calendar
- The process made from thinking about the problem, how to solve it, what model to use
- The development of the project and each feature of the model
- A series of experiments for testing the crossover/mutation functions and the hiper-parameters that work better 
- A conclusion
- Possible features to add

#### CHARM
Charm is the result of a research in chatbot testing. The tool, that compliments BOTIUM, can help the chatbot programmer test the chatbot by augmenting the training dataset with different methods. There is also an improvement in some BOTIUM features. 

To use charm you can click on the link to the repossitory:
[CHARM github](https://charmtool.github.io/Charm/)

A more detailed explanation of the project and functionallity is given in the article presented in 2020 QUATIC's conference.
