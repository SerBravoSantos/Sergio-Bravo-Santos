## Introduction

For me, coming to Dublin (Ireland) has becomed an opportunity for discovering new places to visit, different tastes to try, people that introduced me to their cultures and that I shared really good moments with and lots more...
As you can see, living abroad can open you a wide range of novel experiences that can frighten anyone but at the end it will make you learn and grow personally, as you enjoy the path. 

Nevertheless, and here is where I tell you what this page is created for, I had as many good occurrences, as bad ones. 
In specific, in this page we will talk about the really hard aspect of living with more people in(at?) the same house, and this aspect is the organization for doing all the common duties needed in order to keep the common areas of the house cleaned and enjoyable for living. 

Since I came to this house, about 8 months ago, the method used for the cleanse of the common spaces have been a handmade task calendar that contained a fixed structure of different tasks spreaded over the month, and the different housemates assigned for each of the task. This is a great idea, but I was lazy to create my calendar, and this is the reason why I started developing this project!
